This is the readme of TL1.
I will be doing Boss enemy manager.
The combat mechanism includes melee-based player attacks using collision detection for hit registration. Enemy entities contain a health management system that reduces health upon receiving damage and triggers a death sequence when health reaches zero. The system is modular and expandable for combo attacks and ranged mechanics.
